  LCTuple release notes
 ======================

 --------
| v01-05 |
 --------

F.Gaede
 - protect against missing collections in CreateRecoRelations.cc

S.Lu
 -  Implement CalorimeterHitBranches into LCTuple.

A.Ebrahimi
 - Added covariance matrix histograms to jet branches

J.List
 - added lctuple_DST.xml  to convert current DST to root



 --------
| v01-04 |
 --------

   - Added JetBranches which holds branches created from a jet collection
     created by Satoru Jet Finder processor.
     JetBranches has two steerable parameters which are optionally
     set in the steering file:
      * writeExtraParameters: if set to TRUE, the fill function
        calculates some extra parameters using parameters provided
        by the jet finding algorithm. Default value is FALSE.
        See class data members for a list of extra parameters.
      * writeTaggingParameters: if set to TRUE, the fill function
        creates branches for jet parameters coming form flavor tagging
        processor. If no flavor tagging processr is used, this should
        be set to FALSE to prevent errors. Default value is FALSE.
        See class data members for a list of extra parameters.
   - Added isolated lepton branches
   - Added MC particle from relation branches
   - Added MC particle remove overlay branches
